Teleport uses mutual TLS authentication with self-hosted databases. These
databases must be configured with a certificate authority to be able to verify
client certificates. They also need a certificate/key pair that the Teleport
Database Service can verify.

You can configure databases to trust either the Teleport database CA or a CA of
your choosing.

If you plan to use the Teleport database CA with Teleport Cloud, your Teleport
user must be allowed to impersonate the system role `Db` in order to be able to
generate the database certificate.

Include the following `allow` rule in in your Teleport Cloud user's role:

```yaml
allow:
  impersonate:
    users: ["Db"]
    roles: ["Db"]
```
